## CPU Fan Control using Fuzzy Logic System Documentation

### Overview

This Python script implements a Fuzzy Control system using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the scikit-fuzzy library for fuzzy logic. The system takes user inputs for temperature and frequency, applies fuzzy control rules, and outputs the corresponding fan speed.


### Usage

1. Run the script (fuzzy_fan_speed_control.py).
2. Enter the temperature (0 - 100Â°C) and frequency (0 - 4.5GHz) in the respective entry fields.
3. Click "Calculate Fan Speed" to compute and display the fan speed and its classification.
4. Optionally, click "Show Graph" to visualize the fuzzy membership functions.


### Note: 

- "if A and B, then C" - this format won't work, i have to fix this.
- use this format instead, "A and B, C"
